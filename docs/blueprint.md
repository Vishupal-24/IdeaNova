## Style Guidelines:

- Use a muted color palette with colors like slate gray (#708090), and a deep charcoal (#36454F) to evoke a sense of sophistication and calm.
- In dark mode, employ deep onyx (#353839) backgrounds complemented by silver accents (#C0C0C0) for readability and a touch of elegance.
- In light mode, use off-white (#FAFAFA) backgrounds with shadow gray (#A9A9A9) to maintain a bright, spacious feel without harsh contrasts.
- Opt for 'Lora' for headlines and 'Lato' for body text. This pairing offers readability with a touch of sophistication, making the UI both attractive and understandable.
- Incorporate minimalist icons with fine details. These icons should communicate functionality without being obtrusive, contributing to an overall premium feel.
- Adopt an asymmetrical layout to guide the user's eye and create focal points, enhancing both aesthetic appeal and intuitive navigation.
- Integrate subtle, slow animations (e.g., fade-ins, gentle parallax effects) to add a layer of depth and sophistication, improving engagement without being distracting.
